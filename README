= jQuery Easter Eggs =

Allows for hidden behavior to occur after a user types
given strings into document. It's silly.

REQUIREMENTS

* jQuery 1.2.3

USAGE

This snippet will show the element #some_id when the user
types 'info' at any point.

  $('#some_id').addEgg('info', function() {
    $(this).show();
  });

You can also have generic handlers that don't correspond to
any particular jQuery objects.

This snippet will show all elements with the class name "info"
and hide all elements with the class name "not-info" after
the user types "info".

  $.easterEggs.add('info', function() {
    $('.info').show();
    $('.not-info').hide();
  });
